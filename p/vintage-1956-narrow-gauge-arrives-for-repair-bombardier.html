They called us a few days earlier but were supposed to send photos. Well they didn&#x27;t send photos and just showed up. They have a 1956 C-17 Bombardier Narrow Gauge. I guided them out to the shop. Not going to lie, Dad stopped taking notes on what had to be done. But after talking with them, Dad thinks he can help. These customers are working men involved in commercial fishing and at age 83, Dad just wants to get them mobile. A very serious conversation was had about what we had to do and they will have to come back and help if they want their machine this winter. We have already agreed that the tracks have to come off, replace or repair axles, new bearings, put in an access plate for the motor and re-do all the wiring. If it starts and moves, that will what we can do this for them for now. No time for installing anything pretty. Going to be very interesting taking this machine apart and putting back together.<br /><br />Bombardier is a Canadian company known for its innovation and excellence in the transportation industry. The company has been producing snow vehicles for more than 60 years, including snow buses that are used for passenger transport in extreme weather conditions. <br /><br />Armand Bombardier from Valcourt, Quebec nailed a design that became a template for mechanized snow travel. His first product was a wood enclosed vehicle with tracks in the back and skis in the front that carried seven people. He began selling his B-7 in 1937. Through the war he was involved in making equipment for the war effort but in 1942 he produced a production model of the B-12. The B-12 was made of metal but followed the same design as the B-7 and he also built larger 18 passenger B-18 versions. Though they could be painted any colour the standard production model was a shade of yellow not unlike the colour of school buses and for the same reason, visibility. <br /> <br />The snow buses were designed to transport people in remote areas, such as logging camps and mining sites and all over the north by Natural Resources, as ambulances, school buses, mail delivery and bus/taxi operators. These early snow buses were rugged, durable, and able to travel over difficult terrain, including deep snow and ice. <br /> <br />Over time, Bombardier continued to innovate and improve upon its snow bus designs. In the 1960s, the company introduced the B12 snow bus, which was the first snow bus specifically designed for passenger transport. The B12 had a capacity of 12 passengers and was equipped with a powerful diesel engine, a heating system, and a comfortable interior. The operation of a Bombardier snow bus is similar to that of a conventional bus. The driver sits in a cab at the front of the vehicle and uses a steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedals to control the bus. The snow bus is equipped with a powerful engine and a track system that allows it to travel over deep snow and ice. <br /> <br />The track system consists of rubber tracks that are attached to the wheels of the bus. The tracks provide traction and stability in snowy and icy conditions, allowing the bus to navigate difficult terrain safely. <br /> <br />The interior of a Bombardier snow bus is designed to provide maximum comfort for passengers. The bus is equipped with heating and ventilation systems that ensure a comfortable temperature inside the vehicle, even in extreme weather conditions. The seats are designed to be comfortable and provide ample legroom, and the bus is equipped with large windows that offer panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. <br /> <br />Repairing a Bombardier snow bus can be a complex and challenging process. The snow bus is a highly specialized vehicle that requires specialized knowledge and tools to repair. The track system, in particular, is a critical component of the snow bus that requires careful maintenance and repair. Bombardier snow buses have a long and successful history of providing safe and reliable transportation in extreme weather conditions. Their operation is similar to that of conventional buses, but their specialized track system allows them to navigate difficult terrain safely. Repairing a snow bus can be complex and challenging, requiring specialized knowledge and tools. #bombardier #restoration #carrestoration</div>
